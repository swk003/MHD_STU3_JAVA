# MHD_STU3_JAVA

The code within this GitHub repository was used during the HL7 San Diego WGM 201709 MHD STU3 (Track 3) Connectathon to demonstrate the FHIR STU3 MHD XML transaction content. 

These examples make use of the opensource [JAVA FHIR API](https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/)

The examples build Mobile access to Health Documents (MHD) With XDS on FHIR (HL7® FHIR® STU 3). See the MHD profiles [Rev. 2.3 – Trial Implementation](http://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_MHD.pdf) Date: July 24, 2017
